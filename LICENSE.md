1. You can use this bundle to organize your Twig components, automate your asset
   injection, and finally stop the "where is that CSS file?" scavenger hunt.
2. If this bundle saves you from the architectural nightmare of scattering files 
   across four different directories, you are encouraged to celebrate with 
   a slightly longer coffee break.
3. You must include the original copyright notice in your copies.

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. If it somehow 
convinces your Stimulus controllers to go on strike or makes your Twig 
templates feel lonely, the author is not liable.

Keep your components co-located and your DX high. 🚀
